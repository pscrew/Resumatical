# Resumatical
apply to jobs with your resume when your too busy working for a company you want to leave

To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Additionally, you may need to install the requests library if it's not already installed. You can install it by running pip install requests in your terminal.

Before running the script, make sure to customize the variables in the main() function with your own information. You can also modify the generate_resume() and apply_to_job() functions to match the resume template and the job application process for the specific websites you're targeting.

Once you have customized the script, you can run it, and it will automatically apply to each remote job opportunity listed in the jobs variable, using the generated resume. It will print the application status for each job.

Please note that this script provides a basic structure to automate the process, but it may require further customization to match the specific requirements and APIs of different job websites.
